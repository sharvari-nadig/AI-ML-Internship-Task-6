# Task 6 – Linear Regression: House Price Prediction

## Dataset Used
California Housing Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Objective
To build a Linear Regression model for predicting house prices and evaluate it using MAE and RMSE.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded California housing dataset
- Performed basic data inspection
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Predicted house prices
- Evaluated model using MAE and RMSE
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices
- Interpreted model coefficients
